<h1>I'm Todd Garon</h1>
<p>I'm a programmer in Washington, DC. My main focus is on AV control systems for commercial and government customers.</p>
<p>When not at work, I maintain a somewhat active physics research program, focusing on the intersection of Supersymmetry breaking and flavor model building, run a monthly night at a bar focused on cassette appreciation, and do a lot of crossword puzzles. I'm also not a terrible cook</p>
